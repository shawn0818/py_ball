            The 'parameters' key describes the parameters provided in \
            the API call. The 'resultSets' key contains the data returned \
            in the API call.

        **data** (*dict*): A dictionary of response names. Each response \
            name is a key to a list of dictionaries containing the \
            corresponding data.
